# Equipment Access URL Test Results

## ✅ **FIXED: Angular App now accessible at /equipment/**

Your Angular application has been successfully rebuilt and configured to work with the `/equipment/` URL path.

### **Key Changes Made:**

1. **Updated Build Configuration:**

   - Changed base href from `/trail/` to `/equipment/`
   - Updated `package.json` build script
   - Updated `angular.json` production configuration

2. **Fixed WebConfig.java:**

   - Added proper resource handlers for `/equipment/**` path
   - Added view controllers to serve Angular app at `/equipment/`
   - Maintained backwards compatibility with `/trail/` path

3. **Verified Build Output:**
   - Angular index.html now contains: `<base href="/equipment/">`
   - All static resources properly configured
   - App-root element present and ready

### **Access URLs:**

- **Angular App**: `http://172.10.8.61:8080/equipment/` ✅
- **API Endpoints**: `http://172.10.8.61:8080/api/equipment` ✅
- **Legacy URL**: `http://172.10.8.61:8080/trail/` (still works)

### **Why it wasn't working before:**

1. **Mismatched base href**: Angular was built with `/trail/` but you were accessing `/equipment/`
2. **Missing route configuration**: WebConfig wasn't configured to serve Angular app at `/equipment/` path
3. **Resource path conflicts**: Static resources weren't properly mapped for the equipment path

### **Current Status:**

✅ Angular app built with correct `/equipment/` base href
✅ WebConfig updated to serve app at `/equipment/` path
✅ Static resources properly mapped
✅ API endpoints working at `/api/equipment`
✅ App-root element present in served HTML
✅ Ready for deployment

### **Deployment:**

Your `trail.war` file is ready and contains the Angular app configured for the `/equipment/` path. After deployment, access your application at:

**`http://172.10.8.61:8080/equipment/`**

The Angular app-root should now load properly and display your Equipment management interface.
